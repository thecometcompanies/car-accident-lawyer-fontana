        <h2>Understanding Comparative Negligence in California</h2>
        <p>If you've been injured in a car accident in Fontana or anywhere in San Bernardino County, understanding California's comparative negligence laws is crucial to protecting your rights and maximizing your compensation.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Comparative Negligence?</h3>
        <p>California follows a "pure comparative negligence" rule. This means that even if you were partially at fault for the accident, you can still recover damages â€“ but your compensation will be reduced by your percentage of fault.</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works in Fontana Car Accidents</h3>
        <p>For example, if you were involved in a collision on Sierra Avenue and the total damages were $100,000, but you were found to be 20% at fault, you could still recover $80,000 (80% of the total damages).</p>
        
        <h3>Common Scenarios in San Bernardino County</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Speeding on I-10 through Fontana when another driver runs a red light</li>
          <li>Not wearing a seatbelt when hit by a drunk driver</li>
          <li>Making an improper lane change when rear-ended</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why You Need a Fontana Car Accident Lawyer</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Gather evidence to minimize your fault percentage</li>

      content: `
        <h2>Essential Steps After a Car Accident in Fontana</h2>
        <p>Being involved in a car accident on Fontana's busy streets like Sierra Avenue or Foothill Boulevard can be overwhelming. Here's what you need to do immediately:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Ensure Safety First</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check yourself and passengers for injuries</li>
          <li>Move to a safe location if possible</li>
          <li>Turn on hazard lights</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Call 911</h3>
        <p>Always call the police, especially for accidents in high-traffic areas like the I-10 and I-15 interchange. A police report is crucial for your claim.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Document Everything</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Take photos of all vehicles involved</li>
          <li>Photograph the accident scene from multiple angles</li>
          <li>Get witness contact information</li>
          <li>Note weather and road conditions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Exchange Information</h3>
        <p>Get the following from all drivers involved:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name and contact information</li>
          <li>Insurance company and policy number</li>
          <li>Driver's license number</li>
          <li>License plate number</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5. Seek Medical Attention</h3>
        <p>Even if you feel fine, see a doctor. Some injuries, like whiplash, may not show symptoms immediately.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Contact a Fontana Car Accident Lawyer</h3>
        <p>Before speaking with insurance companies, consult with an experienced attorney who knows Fontana's roads and California law.</p>
