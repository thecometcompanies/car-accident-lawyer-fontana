    content: `<h2>ðŸš¨ Critical Steps to Protect Your Legal Rights</h2>
    <p>If you've been injured in a car accident in Fontana, time is of the essence. Follow these expert-recommended steps to protect your legal rights and maximize your potential compensation.</p>
    <h3>1. Ensure Safety and Call 911</h3>
    <p>Your safety is the top priority. Even for minor accidents, calling 911 creates an official record and ensures proper medical evaluation.</p>
    <h3>2. Document Everything</h3>
    <p>Take photos of vehicles, injuries, and the accident scene. Get witness contact information and statements if possible.</p>
    <h3>3. Seek Medical Attention</h3>
    <p>Many injuries don't show symptoms immediately. Getting medical care creates a record linking your injuries to the accident.</p>
    <h3>4. Contact an Attorney</h3>
    <p>Insurance companies have teams of lawyers working to minimize payouts. Level the playing field with experienced legal representation.</p>
    <h3>5. Avoid Common Mistakes</h3>
    <p>Don't admit fault, don't accept the first settlement offer, and don't give recorded statements without legal counsel.</p>`,
