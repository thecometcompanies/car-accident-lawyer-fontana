      <h2>üö® Critical Steps to Protect Your Legal Rights</h2>
      <p>If you've been injured in a car accident in Fontana, time is of the essence. Follow these expert-recommended steps to protect your legal rights and maximize your potential compensation.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Ensure Safety and Call 911</h3>
      <p>Your safety is the top priority. Even for minor accidents, calling 911 creates an official record and ensures proper medical evaluation. Hidden injuries like whiplash and concussions often don't show symptoms immediately.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Document Everything</h3>
      <p>Take photos of vehicles, injuries, and the accident scene. Get witness contact information and statements if possible. This evidence can be worth tens of thousands of dollars in your final settlement.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Seek Medical Attention</h3>
      <p>Many injuries don't show symptoms immediately. Getting medical care creates a record linking your injuries to the accident. This is crucial for your insurance claim and legal case.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Contact an Attorney</h3>
      <p>Insurance companies have teams of lawyers working to minimize payouts. Level the playing field with experienced legal representation. Studies show attorney representation increases settlements by 300% or more.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Avoid Common Mistakes</h3>
      <p>Don't admit fault, don't accept the first settlement offer, and don't give recorded statements without legal counsel. These mistakes can cost you thousands in compensation.</p>
