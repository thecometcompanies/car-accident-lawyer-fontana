        <div class="img-caption">Car accidents on Fontana's busy streets require immediate action to protect your legal rights</div>
        
        <p><strong>Were you just involved in a car accident in Fontana or San Bernardino County?</strong> The next few minutes and hours are absolutely critical for protecting your legal rights and ensuring you receive the maximum compensation you deserve.</p>
        
        <p>As experienced Fontana car accident attorneys, we've seen too many victims make costly mistakes immediately after their crash. Follow this expert guide to safeguard your future and avoid the pitfalls that could cost you thousands in compensation.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT WARNING</h3>
            <p><strong>DO NOT speak to the other driver's insurance company before reading this guide.</strong> Insurance adjusters are trained to minimize payouts, and anything you say can be used against you later.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="step-number">1</span>Ensure Safety and Call 911 Immediately</h2>
        
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625149992652-ace1ac048a3d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Emergency responders at car accident scene">
        <div class="img-caption">Emergency responders arriving at accident scene - always call 911 first</div>
        
        <p>Your safety is the absolute priority. Even if the accident seems minor, <strong>always call 911</strong>. Here's why this step is non-negotiable:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden injuries are common:</strong> Adrenaline can mask serious injuries like whiplash, concussions, or internal bleeding</li>
            <li><strong>Official police report:</strong> This creates an unbiased record of the accident that insurance companies and courts recognize</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic control:</strong> Police can manage traffic flow and prevent secondary accidents</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence preservation:</strong> Officers will document the scene before it's disturbed</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>üìç Fontana-Specific Tip</h3>
            <p>Accidents on major Fontana thoroughfares like <strong>Sierra Avenue, Foothill Boulevard, or I-10</strong> require immediate police response due to heavy traffic. Don't risk your safety trying to move vehicles yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="step-number">2</span>Document Everything Like Your Compensation Depends on It</h2>
        
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551721434-8b94ddff0e6d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Person taking photos of car damage with smartphone">
        <div class="img-caption">Thorough documentation can make or break your compensation claim</div>
        
        <p>The evidence you collect in these first few minutes can be worth tens of thousands of dollars in your final settlement. Here's your complete documentation checklist:</p>

        <div class="checklist">
            <h3>üì± Essential Photos to Take:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úÖ All vehicle damage from multiple angles</li>
                <li>‚úÖ The entire accident scene (wide shots)</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Street signs, traffic signals, and road conditions</li>
                <li>‚úÖ License plates of all vehicles involved</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Driver's licenses and insurance cards</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Any visible injuries (if appropriate)</li>
                <li>‚úÖ Skid marks, debris, or property damage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>üë• Witness Information is Gold</h3>
        <p>Witnesses provide unbiased accounts that can prove fault. Get:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Full names and contact information</li>
            <li>What they saw and heard</li>
            <li>Their location when the accident occurred</li>
            <li>If possible, record their statement on your phone</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span class="step-number">3</span>Exchange Information (But Say Very Little)</h2>
        
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450101499163-c8848c66ca85?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Two people exchanging insurance information after car accident">
        <div class="img-caption">Exchange essential information but avoid discussing fault or details</div>
        
        <p>You're legally required to exchange certain information, but <strong>what you say matters immensely</strong>. Here's exactly what to do:</p>

        <h3>‚úÖ Information to Exchange:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Driver's license numbers</li>
            <li>Insurance company names and policy numbers</li>
            <li>Vehicle makes, models, years, and license plates</li>
            <li>Contact information (names, addresses, phone numbers)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>‚ùå What NOT to Say:</h3>
        <div class="warning-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"I'm sorry"</strong> - This can be interpreted as admitting fault</li>
                <li><strong>"I didn't see you"</strong> - Admits negligence</li>
                <li><strong>"I was speeding/texting/distracted"</strong> - Direct admission of fault</li>
                <li><strong>"I'm fine"</strong> - Injuries often appear hours or days later</li>
                <li>Any speculation about what happened</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="step-number">4</span>Seek Medical Attention (Even If You Feel "Fine")</h2>
        
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559757148-5c350d0d3c56?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Doctor examining patient after car accident">
        <div class="img-caption">Medical evaluation within 24 hours strengthens your injury claim significantly</div>
        
        <p>This step can literally make the difference between a $5,000 settlement and a $50,000+ settlement. Here's why immediate medical care is crucial:</p>

        <h3>üè• Why Immediate Medical Care Matters:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hidden injuries are real:</strong> Whiplash, concussions, and soft tissue injuries often don't show symptoms for 24-48 hours</li>
            <li><strong>Medical records create a timeline:</strong> This directly links your injuries to the accident</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance companies look for delays:</strong> Waiting weeks to see a doctor gives them ammunition to deny your claim</li>
            <li><strong>Early treatment = better outcomes:</strong> Prompt care often leads to faster healing and less long-term damage</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>üè• Recommended Fontana Medical Facilities:</h3>
            <p><strong>Kaiser Permanente Fontana Medical Center</strong> - 9961 Sierra Ave<br>
            <strong>Fontana Emergency Medical Center</strong> - 17051 Sierra Lakes Pkwy<br>
            <strong>San Antonio Regional Hospital</strong> - 999 San Bernardino Rd (nearby Upland)</p>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="step-number">5</span>Contact a Fontana Car Accident Attorney BEFORE Speaking to Insurance</h2>
        
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521791136064-7986c2920216?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Professional attorney meeting with car accident client">
        <div class="img-caption">Experienced legal representation often increases settlements by 300% or more</div>
        
        <p>This is the step that separates victims who receive fair compensation from those who get taken advantage of by insurance companies.</p>

        <h3>üéØ Why Attorney Consultation is Critical:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Insurance companies have teams of lawyers</strong> - You need someone on your side</li>
            <li><strong>Initial offers are typically 10-20% of fair value</strong> - Attorneys know true case worth</li>
            <li><strong>Legal deadlines are strict</strong> - California's 2-year statute of limitations has no exceptions</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence disappears quickly</strong> - Attorneys can preserve crucial evidence before it's lost</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>üí∞ Settlement Reality Check</h3>
            <p><strong>Without Attorney:</strong> Average settlement $15,000 - $25,000<br>
            <strong>With Experienced Attorney:</strong> Average settlement $45,000 - $80,000</p>
            <p><em>*Based on similar injury cases in San Bernardino County</em></p>

                <li><strong>Giving recorded statements to insurance</strong> - These can be edited and used against you</li>
                <li><strong>Posting on social media</strong> - Insurance investigators monitor your accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Waiting to hire an attorney</strong> - Evidence disappears and witnesses become harder to find</li>
                <li><strong>Not following medical advice</strong> - Insurance companies will claim you weren't really injured</li>

        <h2>üîç Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>Q: How long do I have to file a car accident claim in California?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> You have 2 years from the date of the accident to file a personal injury lawsuit. However, it's crucial to contact an attorney immediately to preserve evidence and protect your rights.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: What if I was partially at fault for the accident?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> California follows "comparative negligence" laws. Even if you were partially at fault, you can still recover damages. For example, if you were 20% at fault and damages were $100,000, you could still recover $80,000.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Never accept the first offer without consulting an attorney. Initial offers are typically 10-20% of the true case value. Insurance companies hope you'll settle quickly before understanding your rights.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: What if the other driver doesn't have insurance?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> You may still have options through your own uninsured motorist coverage or by pursuing the other driver's personal assets. An experienced attorney can explore all available avenues for compensation.</p>
